<!-- Main points -->
## Main points
<ul>
  <li>List screen and detail screen were implemented</li>
  <li>
    Opted to implement a single state representing the possible modes the screen might be in, so I could fit it into the timebox.
    The other option would be to have a reducer implementation for each substate
  </li>
  <li>Lacking unit tests so I could fit this in the allowed timebox</li>
</ul>
